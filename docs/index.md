# PingOne Provider

The PingOne provider interacts with the configuration of the PingOne platform via the management API. The provider requires credentials from worker application client before it can be used.

## Getting Started

Coming soon

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingone = {
      source  = "pingidentity/pingone"

    }
  }
}

provider "pingone" {
  client_id      = var.client_id
  client_secret  = var.client_secret
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  region         = var.region
